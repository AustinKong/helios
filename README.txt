## About

### Description
Project "Helios", is a planetary simulation built using Unity, based on Newton's universal law of gravitation and Kepler's 1st law of planetary motion.
Some info:
* Trajectory shown when creating a celestial body is not an absolute prediction of its trajectory, it is merely the treajectory that would be taken if m1 >> m2
* Units used in this project are not accurate to reality, so are the conversions and representations - this is merely a fun project to observe the effects to Newton's Law
* G = 0.6
* Constant time step: 0.02s
### Technology
* Unity: Game engine to run the simulation
* C#: Backend logic
